# file-server-go
An application that exposes an API accepting and serving files.

# TODO
- [ ] Build the file server app into a docker image
- [ ] Find out why minio actions are so slow: for a 500MB file, it takes 4 ~ 9 seconds to upload (it could be the limited resources allocated)
- [ ] Write more unit tests, some with dependency injection
